- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Scott! 

I have spent the better part of my last 5 years working full time, in a technical project leader role. I first started my journey coding in college, becoming 
familiar with Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, and COBOL (yes COBOL). A few years ago I started to familiarize myself with Swift. I enjoyed my time learning but eventually 
took a break, but I am back! I plan on using this space to commit some of the side projects I work on as I continue my learning journey. 

I am currently working on a weather app called 'Simplee Weather'. It is coming together quite nicely, and it is a minimilistic weather app without all of the fluff. The idea behind this app is that you shouldn't have to dig for your current conditions it should be faceup immediately.
